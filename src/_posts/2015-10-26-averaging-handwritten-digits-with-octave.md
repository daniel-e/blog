title: Averaging handwritten digits with Octave 
---

The MNIST database of handwritten digits (see [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) is a very popular dataset used by the machine learning research community for testing the performance of classification algorithms. It contains 60,000 labeled training examples of handwritten digits between 0 and 9 (both including) and 10,000 labeled examples for testing. Each digit is represented as a grayscale image each with a width and height of 28 pixels. The value of a pixel is in the interval [0, 255].

The following image is ...  of the first 100 images. It has been created with the script ...
